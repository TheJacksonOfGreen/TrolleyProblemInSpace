# The Trolley Problem...IN SPACE!

For the final project of GAME1000 Games and Society, my group was inspired by games with poorly-explained "Morality" Systems that judge your actions and change gameplay accordingly. So, we decided to create a game with a deliberately confusing Morality system. 

You are a representative of humanity, chosen by aliens to test if Humans are up to the ethical standards of the rest of the galaxy. If you are judged well, Earth will be allowed to join the greater galactic community. If not, Earth will be destroyed. So no pressure. 

Use WASD to move, and Space to Jump. Answer the questions to the best of your ability.
